FLIR Kernel Sysfs Layer Helper applications

This package is intended to be used as a abstraction layer between the
userspace and the kernel.

It is implemented in the form of shell scripts, which the userspace
can call to perform certain functions

- fb_setoverlay.sh
  Select which framebuffer to have 2-layer-fb

  Toggle framebuffers between "1-layer-fb" mode and "2-layer-fb"
  (bg/fg) mode, set which framebuffer shows the record symbol overlay.

  Takes one argument, 'viewfinder' or 'lcd'

  example: fb_setoverlay.sh lcd
  result: toggles the lcd framebuffer to be in mode "2-layer-fb-bg"

- display_enable.sh
  Set display in active mode

  Arguments: Takes display argument, allowed 'viewfinder', 'lcd'

  - display_enable.sh viewfinder
    Enables power and parallell data bus to the viewfinder, enables
    overlay on the viewfinder, adjust position of the viewfinder
    overlay due to resolution differences between overlay and
    viewfinder.

  - display_enable.sh lcd
    turn off the power and parallell data bus to the viewfinder
    enables overlay on the LCD.

- fb_alpha.c
  A utility from
  http://www.armadeus.org/wiki/index.php?title=I.MX6_Framebuffer_Overlay
  Which controls the imx framebuffer using IOCTL calls.
  Used by display_enable.sh to adjust overlay framebuffer position
