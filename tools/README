meta-flir-base
==============
FLIR setup for imx7 yocto is to add a layer on top of freescale 
distribution.

meta-flir-base: FLIR open source yocto distribution
Layer addition as such is added through files in meta-flir-base/tools folder

Fetching code (public):
1.  mkdir <your selection>
2.  cd <your selection>
3.  repo init -u ssh://git@bitbucketcommercial.flir.com:7999/im7/flir-yocto-manifest.git -m flir-exported.xml
    (flir-exported.xml as manifest, master as branch, 
     use -b/-m flags if change to this is required)
4.  repo sync
5a. MACHINE=bblc source ./flir-setup-release.sh -b build_bblc
5b. (or, for wayland, 
    MACHINE=bblc DISTRO=fsl-imx-wayland source ./flir-setup-release.sh -b build_bblc-wl)
6.  bitbake core-image-minimal

Note;
FLIR cameras uses meta-flir-base as distributed for FLIR public components.
As an addition to this there is a meta-flir-internal yocto layer that contains
non public code.
Camera content thus has some additons to images that extends this public code
